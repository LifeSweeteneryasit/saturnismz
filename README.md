Ray used this repository for many of his demos during his talks around the world in conferences. You can find a list of Ray's videos on how to run the demos in his [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4uYfigiauVYH4OwOyq8FGbPQOn-JueEf).

But specifically, checkout the one from [Jfokus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2l-tL_1els&index=6&list=PL4uYfigiauVYH4OwOyq8FGbPQOn-JueEf).
